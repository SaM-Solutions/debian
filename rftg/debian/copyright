License: Gracious permission
 Rio Grande Games is the publisher and holds all the copyrights for the
 images and card names. They have graciously given permission for Keldon
 Jones to distribute these, though they may not be redistributed or used
 for any other purpose.

X-Debian-Comment: Even though the code is under the GPL version 2 or any later version
 (see COPYING), the following mail was received from the author:
 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=525764#c15
 (and the next one):
 .
 "Rio Grande Games is the publisher and holds all the copyrights for the images
 and card names. They have graciously given permission for me to distribute
 these, though they may not be used for any other purpose."
 .
 "I'm afraid that, as I understand my agreement with Rio Grande, only I
 can legally distribute the card and other images included with the
 game (though other people could pursue similar agreements, and have).
 In addition, my permission expires when/if a commercial "official"
 computer version of the game is released.  Supposedly such a thing is in
 the works, though I have my doubts as to whether it will be completed.
 I think that distributing RFTG as a Fedora (or Debian or other distro)
 package is not advisable."
 .
 So, this package is definitely non-free (the card image data at least).
