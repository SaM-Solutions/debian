Please read the license in COPYING (which is similar to

in the copyright file to understand why this package is in fact non-free.

The package is delivered with the trained neural networks, but it is
possible to retrain them with what is bound in the source (albeit the
result will be different, due to the non-deterministic nature of the
training).
